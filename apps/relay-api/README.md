# Relay Backend

Local proof-of-concept persistence backend for Browser Memory Recorder's canonical
workflow documents, plus provider-neutral automation, a Browserbase worker, and a
private internal execution service with streaming and in-memory batch APIs.
The FastAPI service implements the repository's `openapi.yaml`, including atomic
revisions, global idempotency, privacy-safe summaries, and shared HTTP Basic
authentication. It also exposes authenticated direct-run, batch, and artifact gateways
to the private run service. Organizational namespaces own workflows without acting as
authorization boundaries. Canonical workflow documents live in a private S3-compatible
bucket; PostgreSQL stores their active object keys and safe relational metadata. The
service does not execute workflows itself. New drafts and explicit saves use canonical
schema `1.5`; stored schema `1.2` and `1.4` documents remain readable for compatibility.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Python 3.12 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Docker with Compose
- A private S3-compatible bucket and its credentials
- Node.js 24 or newer for automation packages

Install Node dependencies once from the repository root with `npm ci`. Run the Python
setup below from `apps/relay-api/`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
uv sync --extra dev
docker compose up -d --wait postgres
set -a
source .env
set +a
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn relay_backend.main:app --reload --no-access-log
```

The API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The read-only Scalar API reference is
at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`; its selector includes **Workflow Storage** and
**Workflow Runs**. The persistence contract remains available from
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json`. The local documentation page loads its pinned
Scalar browser bundle from jsDelivr, so opening it requires internet access.

The run reference documents the separate private Browserbase service. FastAPI adds
`POST /v1/run-by-id`, plus public `POST /v1/batches` and `GET /v1/batches/{batchId}`
gateways. Batch creation accepts complete Local or Relay workflow documents as opaque
JSON and never retries them; the private service remains authoritative for execution
validation. The optional local `/api/inngest` adapter is orchestration
owned by the Inngest SDK, not a third Relay API, so use the local Inngest guide and UI
rather than the API reference for that path.

Create a namespace, then create a draft in it using fresh UUIDs for each logical mutation:

```bash
curl \
  --user "$BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(python -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())')" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"name":"Personal"}' \
  --request POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/namespaces

# Copy the returned namespace id.
NAMESPACE_ID="..."

curl \
  --user "$BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(python -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())')" \
  --request POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/namespaces/$NAMESPACE_ID/workflows"
```

The flat `/v1/workflows` routes remain deprecated compatibility aliases in contract
version 1.3. Flat creation targets `Default`; flat reads and mutations retain global
workflow-ID behavior. Their removal is reserved for contract version 2.0.

With the private automation service running, execute a completed stored workflow by UUID:

```bash
curl \
  --user "$BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD" \
  --header "Accept: application/x-ndjson" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"workflowId\":\"$WORKFLOW_ID\"}" \
  --no-buffer \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/run-by-id
```

The response is the private service's NDJSON stream. Disconnecting closes the upstream
request, runs are never retried automatically, and relative terminal thumbnail URLs are
served through authenticated `GET /v1/artifacts/{artifactId}`.

Queue and poll a batch containing complete workflow documents:

```bash
curl \
  --user "$BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD" \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"runs\":[{\"workflow\":$WORKFLOW_JSON}]}" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/batches

# Copy batchId from the 202 response.
BATCH_ID="..."
curl \
  --user "$BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD" \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/batches/$BATCH_ID"
```

FastAPI limits batch requests and buffered private responses to 1 MiB. It forwards only
safe response headers, uses a 30-second upstream read timeout, and never logs workflow
documents, parameters, batch IDs, artifact IDs, or private service URLs.

docker compose down --volumes
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Description |

No credentials are built into the application. Copy `.env.example` to the ignored
`.env` file, replace the example password, and populate the service-specific secrets
you use. The sample includes trusted-private-listener screenshot values; deploy the
supporting build with screenshots disabled before enabling them. Other optional
overrides use the runtime defaults listed above.

### S3-compatible document-store rollout

Create a private bucket in each environment and provide its `BUCKET`, `ENDPOINT`,
`ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `REGION` variables to the API service. Deploy
the migration and dual-read application before running:

```bash
uv run python -m relay_backend.backfill_workflow_documents --batch-size 100
```

The command is resumable and never changes revisions, timestamps, summaries, or
idempotency records. Verify the cutover with
`SELECT count(*) FROM workflows WHERE document_key IS NULL`; the result must be zero.
Keep the legacy JSONB column until a later migration after production verification.

## Architecture

The code uses explicit layers without framework-heavy abstractions:

```text
                         ┌→ Data repository → PostgreSQL metadata and summaries
Controller → Service ───┤
                         └→ Document store → private S3-compatible bucket
```

- Controllers translate HTTP requests and responses only.
- The service owns lifecycle, revision, canonicalization, and idempotency behavior.
- The data layer owns parameterized metadata, pointer, summary, and idempotency SQL.
- The document store owns deterministic, bounded canonical workflow objects. PostgreSQL
  publishes the active opaque object key in the same transaction as the safe summary.
- List queries select only PostgreSQL summaries and cannot accidentally return payloads
  or session IDs.
- Alembic uses SQLAlchemy for migrations; runtime queries use Psycopg directly.
- The run gateway resolves stored direct runs by UUID and forwards opaque full-document
  batch requests between the authenticated FastAPI boundary and the private execution
  service. Batch responses are bounded before the public response begins.

[`packages/automation-core`](../../packages/automation-core/README.md) is an independent ESM
library. A background runner supplies an existing Playwright `Page`, receives
transport-neutral events and structured results, and remains responsible for browser
lifecycle and any persistence. It consumes the root `@relay/workflow-contract`
executable schema and delegates provider-neutral Playwright phases to the root
`@relay/replay-core` package. Its compatibility facade maps structured core failures to
privacy-safe background diagnostics. The package has no dependency on FastAPI,
PostgreSQL, Browserbase, or the service's internal persistence model.

[`packages/automation-worker-browserbase`](../../packages/automation-worker-browserbase/README.md)
is the provider-specific server consumer. It validates complete workflows while treating
the required `schemaVersion` value as opaque metadata,
resolves explicit run parameters, owns fresh Browserbase session lifecycle, and returns
privacy-safe events and outcomes. It does not add an execution route to FastAPI or
persist run state. Visibility and element-text assertions execute once without retries.
Repeated-group assertions likewise execute once by comparing bounded, visible structural
candidates through the shared contract's matching rules. Page-text assertions snapshot
the attached visible frame tree once and return only privacy-safe pass/fail diagnostics.

[`apps/automation-service-browserbase`](../automation-service-browserbase/README.md)
is a separate Fastify process exposing unauthenticated local direct and batch execution APIs.
`POST /v1/run` streams privacy-safe NDJSON and cancels on disconnect. `POST /v1/batches`
queues one to ten workflows in process memory, while `GET /v1/batches/{batchId}` polls
safe progress for up to one hour. Batch, direct, and opt-in local Inngest work share the
same five-slot default capacity. The process does not call the persistence API or use
PostgreSQL, and all batch state disappears on restart. Direct and batch terminal
outcomes may include a one-hour relative thumbnail URL backed by a compressed file in
`.relay/artifacts`; files persist for manual cleanup, but URL access does not survive a
restart. In remote deployments, the browser resolves that URL against the authenticated
public FastAPI gateway, which proxies the image to the private Node service. The browser
never contacts the Node service directly. The Inngest path does not capture screenshots.
The Node service still does not read persistence; only FastAPI performs UUID resolution.
Remote deployments must keep this service private and at exactly one replica because
batch state, polling snapshots, and thumbnail capabilities are process-local.

Successful idempotency records are retained indefinitely. A replay with the same key,
method, path, and validated canonical JSON returns the original response even if the
workflow has since changed. Different content returns `409 idempotency_conflict`.

## POC boundaries

The FastAPI service intentionally excludes user accounts, tenant authorization,
namespace rename/deletion/transfer, pagination, workflow deletion, workflow-schema
migration, collaboration, replay execution,
and application-level encryption. The standalone
automation library excludes browser lifecycle, queues, service endpoints, persistence,
retries, recording, and interactive replay controls. The Browserbase worker owns only a
single run. Its HTTP service adds local transport, streaming, health,
shared per-process capacity, and a bounded in-memory batch queue. It still excludes
schedules, durable run persistence, idempotency, reconnection, legacy workflow migration,
user authorization, and authenticated contexts. Workflow documents may contain sensitive
values, so request bodies and workflow contents must not be logged.
Terminal screenshot files are a deliberate local exception to the no-persistence run
model; they have no durable API index and are never deleted automatically.
The execution service has no authentication and defaults to loopback. Screenshots may
also be enabled on an explicitly trusted private listener, but the service is never safe
to expose publicly.

## Browser handoff

The browser automation client still needs the separate integration described in
[`../../docs/handoffs/browser-remote-batch-gateway.md`](../../docs/handoffs/browser-remote-batch-gateway.md).
In summary: remove `AUTOMATION_SERVICE_TOKEN`, use Relay HTTP Basic credentials only at
the public `RELAY_API_BASE_URL`, and keep batch creation non-retrying.
